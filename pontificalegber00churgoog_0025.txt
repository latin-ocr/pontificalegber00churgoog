A faosimile of the title 01 the manuscript “ Exoarp·
sum,” doe, will be found in Silvestre de saey's work
on Palaeography.

The original Pontifioal 01 Arehbishop Egbert must

have been two hundred years older than the present
MS. It may seem probable that a copy 01 the ori-
gina] Pontifioal was taken into Franco by Alouin,
when engaged in assisting Oharlemagne in his restora-
tion 01 the Gallioan Ohuroh, and that the present
MS. may be a oopy 01 such a transcript, mode for the
use 01 the Bishop 01 Evreux. Dr. Rook, in the first
volume of his Ohuroh 01 our FatherS, p. 282, has
spoken of the Anglo-Saxon Mes. being sent over into
Franoe, or copied by Frenoh scribes, 101 the use 01 the
ohurohes there. The Rheims Pontifioal above men·
tioned, p. viii. is one instance. Again, the Rouen
Pontifieal‚ No. 362, appears from an addition at the
end, to have been the Pontifieal 01 the Bishop of Alet,
now Saint Malo, in Britany.

Itis possible that more Anglo·Saxon Mss. may
yet be found in Normandy and Britany. There are
oolleotions 01 Mss. in several 01 the towns, whioh do
not seem to be muoh known3 101 instance, at Valognes
in the Cotentin are one hundred, at Avranohes two
hundred MSS.

The two litanies will be found at pp. 29 and 32.
The names 01 Saint (iuthbert and Saint Guthlao among
· the 0001000010 point to the northern origin 01 the book.

The latest saint named is Saint Guthlae, a monk of
Oroyland, who flourished at the end 01 the seventh
and beginning 01 the eighth century.
